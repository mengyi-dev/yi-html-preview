## Features

* ðŸ“„ **Live HTML Preview:** Opens an accurate preview panel right beside your HTML editor.
* ðŸ”„ **Real-time Updates:** The preview automatically refreshes as you type or save (debounced for performance).
* ðŸ“± **Responsive Design Tools:**
    * **Device Presets:** Quickly switch between common screen sizes (Mobile, Tablet, Laptop) or use a flexible Desktop view.
    * **Orientation Toggle:** Easily flip between Portrait and Landscape modes for fixed-size device presets.
    * **Visual Device Frame:** A simple, clean frame is shown around fixed-size previews for better context.
* ðŸ”— **Relative Path Resolution:** Automatically handles relative paths in your HTML for linked CSS, images, and JavaScript files, ensuring resources load correctly in the preview.
* ðŸ”’ **Secure & Sandboxed:** Uses VS Code's Webview API with a sandboxed `<iframe>` and Content Security Policy for safe rendering.
* âœ¨ **Clean Integration:** Manages previews on a per-file basis and cleans up resources automatically when files or panels are closed.

## Usage

1.  Open any HTML file (`.html`, `.htm`) in your VS Code editor.
2.  Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
3.  Type `Yi HTML Preview` and select the command "**Yi HTML Preview: Show Preview**".
4.  The preview panel will open adjacent to your active editor.
5.  Use the control bar at the top of the preview panel to select different device sizes and toggle the orientation.

## Known Issues

* The preview environment is sandboxed for security. Complex JavaScript, especially involving direct DOM manipulation of the *outer* frame, cross-origin requests, or certain newer/experimental browser APIs, might behave differently than in a full, standalone browser.
* While `<base>` tag injection handles most relative path scenarios, very complex project structures or build tool outputs might require manual path adjustments in some cases.
